The primary purpose of my company is a DJ/Entertainment company. 
However, im also an electrical engineer and every now and then i try to design small pieces of gear that will help out DJs.

Right now everyone is stuck in a digital age, and access to hdmi devices is scarce. im trying to design a simple hdmi capture device
to help DJs (and really anyone) stay connected.

I am happy to make everything open source. i only really have a basic block diagram right now and saw the pid being a potential show stopper.
I can share more as it is designed.
